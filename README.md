# AppointMan

Appointman is a very smart and user friendly **planner** for iPad to **schedule appointments for an haircut shop** with one or more employees.  
The project started in 2015 while I was studying at the [Apple developer academy](https://www.developeracademy.unina.it/it/).  

I spent some time in the summer of 2015 for the development of the UI of the whole app, but then I quit because it would have made sense to complete it only for the purpose of opening a management software company.

_Every single line inside this repo was written by me_, I didn't use **any outside third-party framework** or library.  
Since there were some major changes in the iOS SDK in the last few years, some of the code is not working 100% properly any more: eg. some UI elements are not aligned/sized correctly anymore.

Below there are some examples of the most _relevant components_ of the app running on an iPad simulator with iOS 14:
